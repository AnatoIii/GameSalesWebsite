# GameSalesWebsite

This is our website, which was created to work as games parser.

The main purpose of it is to collect and show all game sales from the most popular game platforms in convinient format, so people won't need to look for and track their favourite game sales everywhere, they will just get a notification, when sales will be somewhere.

### So, we parse such game stores:
- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)
- [Nintendo Store](https://www.nintendo.com/)
- [EpicGames](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/)
- [PS store](https://store.playstation.com/)
- [Uplay](https://uplay.ubisoft.com/)

### Main technologies, that was used are
- .NET Core 3.1 for 4 parsers, Gateway and game storage services
- Angular 9 framework for frontend part
- Spring framework for Nintendo Store parser
- Node.JS for EpicGames store parser
- Python for telegram bot
- As database was used Postres DB

It was created as a semester project in KPI.
